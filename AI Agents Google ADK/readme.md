**AI Agent Development Kit (ADK) Codelabs & Hackathon Starters**

Learn, Build, and Deploy AI Agents with Googleâ€™s Agent Development Kit (ADK).

This repository contains ready-to-run scaffolds for official ADK codelabs and a hackathon-inspired agent app, complete with code, Colab notebooks, and video walkthrough scripts.

ðŸ“Œ Whatâ€™s Inside

**Part A : Codelabs Implementations**

1. From Prototypes to Agents with ADK

2. Building AI Agents with ADK: Empowering with Tools

3. Travel Agent with MCP Toolbox & ADK

  

**Part B: Hackathon Agent Application â€“ Job Interview Agent (ADK)**

ðŸ’¡ Inspired by projects from awesome-adk-agents.

What it does

Runs a Job Interview Agent that conducts mock interviews, asks role-specific questions, and gives targeted feedback.

Uses ADK agent building blocks (tools, memory, policies) for structured multi-turn interviews.

Supports custom interview profiles (role, seniority, competency areas) via config.

Key Features

Dynamic questioning: adapts follow-ups based on candidate answers.

Rubric-based scoring: rates answers across clarity, correctness, depth, and impact.

Actionable feedback: summarizes strengths, gaps, and suggested improvements.

Pluggable LLM/tooling: swap ADK LlmAgent and vector/memory backends as needed.

Tech Stack

ADK Agents (core orchestration)

Python (agent logic & scoring)

Optional: Vector DB (resume/context retrieval), OpenAI/other LLMs
